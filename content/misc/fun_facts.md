- I love music, especially classical music - I began learning the violin after starting college and had a wonderful experience [playing in an enssemble](/img/hobbies/violin.png) with friends at the Cornell Bowers CIS end-of-year party.
- For sports, I enjoy weight lifting, [hiking](/img/hobbies/hiking.jpg), and [biking](/img/hobbies/biking.jpeg) - during spring break in 2025, I biked from Washington, DC to New York City over four days.
- I also enjoy wine tasting. I was fortunate to take a wine-tasting course at the Cornell Hotel School, which introduced me to an entirely new world of wine.
